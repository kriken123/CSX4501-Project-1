An introduction of research question -- 
A question of how different foods impact blood glucose in diabetics.

As a diabetic, this question is particularly important to me.  I've been a diabetic for more than 20 years now and it wasn't until I became pregnant I was hypervigilant about my blood glucose numbers.
As a result of pregnancy, I was taken off all oral medications and switched to insulin.  Currently still breastfeeding and continuing to take insulin.
I've found that different foods have significant impact on blood sugars as expected.  What wasn't expected was even if the glycemic index/load was similar just certain foods spiked my sugars. 
I found the website below that had different datasets from various research publications.

Also a set of personal data from one individual on github:

Intend to analyze blood sugars/glucose ranges after eating certain foods. 
Line graphs showing different points in time where food was eaten and pre/post food glucose levels.
