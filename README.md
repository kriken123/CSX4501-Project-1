# CSX4501-Project-1

An introduction of your research question:

Diamond prices are based on many attributes. This project will explore which attribute contributes most to the price of diamonds.
This topic is of particular interest to me for shallow reasons.  I've always wanted a diamond. 
Diamonds are still the choice stone for most engagement rings and the demand is not slowing even as prices are rising.
In an ideal world if we could have a calculator that predicts the price of the diamond based on the 4C's that would be great.  However, realistically there are too many factors that are objective and hard to quantify (e.g. cut). 
I expect to at the very least determine what attribute contributes to diamond price.

Project 1
An introduction of research question -- 
A question of how different foods impact blood glucose in diabetics.

As a diabetic, this question is particularly important to me.  I've been a diabetic for more than 20 years now and it wasn't until I became pregnant I was hypervigilant about my blood glucose numbers.
As a result of pregnancy, I was taken off all oral medications and switched to insulin.  Currently still breastfeeding and continuing to take insulin.
I've found that different foods have significant impact on blood sugars as expected.  What wasn't expected was even if the glycemic index/load was similar just certain foods spiked my sugars. 
I found the website below that had different datasets from various research publications.

Also a set of personal data from one individual on github:

Intend to analyze blood sugars/glucose ranges after eating certain foods. 
Line graphs showing different points in time where food was eaten and pre/post food glucose levels.
